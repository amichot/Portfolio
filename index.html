        </header>

        <p>
            I am a web developer based in New Orleans. I love a positive work environment and crave the
            satisfaction
            of seeing my work come to life on a web page. I currently study at Thinkful in a full stack web
            development program.
            Outside of programming, my interests include sports, music, outdoor adventure with the dogs, reading
            about new technology, and spending time with friends and family.

            ever organized an event by sending a mass text message that unavoidably leads to everyone's phone

            find it empty? This app excels at keeping you connected and organized. Start by creating an account,
            then head over to your profile page to add your interests. Your home page will show you the events
            you created along with events that match your interests. Search for events around you, find the one
            you like click the title to view the full details of the event, then hit the join button to let the
            event owner you will be attending. Creating an event has never been easier, simply fill out the form
            and tell your friends about the website. As the owner of the event, you will have the ability to
            remove users from the event.

        <h3>Videos with Sentimental Comments and Tweets</h3>
        <p class="description">
            At the home page, the user searches for a YouTube video precisely as he would on Youtube. The results
            page is also similar, the user's search will return a list of related videos. After the user finds
            and clicks the, he wants the app returns the YouTube video, a summary of the video's comments
            sentiment, and tweets related to the user's search. The app uses a sentiment library (AFINN-based
            sentiment analysis for Node.js) to go through each word in the comments and assigns it a value.
            If the comment has an overall positive value, it counts as a positive comment. If it has a
            negative value, it counts as a negative comment. The app sums up the results and returns the
            user a percentage of positive comments, neutral comments, and negative comments. The tweets
            presented at the bottom of the page also use the sentiment library. The user's original search
            is used on Twitter's API. The results are put into the sentiment library to return the most
            positive tweets, most negative tweets, and tweets by tweeters with the most followers (famous tweets).
